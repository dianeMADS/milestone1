# Path to the NBA: a detailed look into ESPN High School Basketball Player ratings predictability on making it to the NBA

As fans of sports, we are interested in potential tools that help signal future player performance. As ESPN’s player rankings are constantly regarded as the source of truth for gauging skill amongst peer groups, we will be looking into the validity of this notion. Through this analysis, we hope to be able to determine:

i. Specific characteristics that top players have in common that make it to the NBA, and how many years it takes players to get drafted 
ii. Overall, how effective is ESPN’s high school basketball rankings at predicting whether a player eventually gets drafted into the league. 

Depending on the results, this analysis could act as a spring board for additional analyses around what players should focus on in order to get ranked and what college/NBA teams should focus on in order to narrow in on top players.
